* Minigrep
the next best text file search tool, written in Rust!

this is a neat little project from The Rust Book, second edition.
Not meant to be particularly useful, as much as a good learning experience.

** Run
there should be a ~poem.txt~ file at the ~src/~ directory for the binary to find.
compile and run with ~cargo run needle poem.txt~
